Basic Git Branch Commands
✅ 1. Create a New Branch
git checkout -b branch-name
Creates and switches to a new branch.

✅ 2. Switch Between Branches
git checkout branch-name
Switch to an existing branch.

✅ 3. Check All Branches
git branch         # local branches
git branch -r      # remote branches
git branch -a      # all (local + remote)

✅ 4. Pull Latest Changes in Current Branch
git pull origin branch-name

✅ 5. Merge Another Branch into Your Current Branch
Merge changes from feature-branch into main:

git checkout main
git pull origin main          # make sure it's updated
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main          # push the merged changes
✅ 6. Push a New Branch to GitHub
git push origin branch-name

🧠 Important Concepts
❓ Do changes in one branch affect others?
No, changes in one branch (like feature-branch) do not affect the main branch until you merge them.

✅ Safe:

You can make any changes in a separate branch.

The main branch will remain unaffected.

Deployment from main will only include code that exists in main.

🚫 Not Safe:

If you merge the feature branch into main without testing, then it affects the main project and deployment.
