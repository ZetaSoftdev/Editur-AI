## Upcoming Tasks


### IMPORTANT

#### Autocaptioning  
- [x] Enable the user to edit Text in the timeline editor 
- [x] Fix the scheduling tab  
- [x] Enable the user to edit Text in the timeline editor 

#### Scheduling
- [ ] Properly create the scheduling page using the exisitng style guidlines
- [x] It should have scheduling feature for Tiktok, Facebook, Youtube and instagram. First you have to create a mechanism for how it will forward the selected video to the given platforms while keeping in mind that all shorts are stored in AWS where we have our API deployed and links of that shorts are stored in our postgre database. You must discuss the implementation with me for example do we need to download it to railway and then forward that video or we can simply forward the aws link. Which approach will be better, discuss with me and i will tell you then how to proceed
