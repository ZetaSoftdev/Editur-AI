  {
    question: "How quickly can I start making money?",
    answer: "Most creators see their first viral video within 72 hours and start monetizing within the first week. Our AI identifies trending patterns and optimizes your content for maximum reach immediately."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any technical skills?",
    answer: "Zero technical skills required! Just paste a YouTube link or upload your video, and our AI handles everything - editing, captions, thumbnails, and posting to all platforms. It's literally point-and-click."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have content to start with?",
    answer: "No problem! Our AI can create faceless videos, generate stories, add voiceovers, and source background footage. You can build a profitable channel without ever showing your face or recording anything."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from hiring a video editor?",
    answer: "A good video editor costs $3,000-5,000/month, takes days to deliver, and works only 8 hours/day. Our AI works 24/7, costs $19/month, and delivers professional results in 60 seconds. Plus, it never gets sick or takes vacation!"
  },
  {
    question: "Can I really make $10K+/month like your testimonials?",
    answer: "Our creators average $8,400/month, with top performers making $25K+. Results depend on consistency and niche, but our AI maximizes your chances by creating content proven to go viral based on millions of data points."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm not satisfied?",
    answer: "We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. Plus, you keep all the videos created during your trial. We're confident you'll love the results, but your satisfaction is guaranteed."
  },
  {
    question: "How many videos can I create?",
    answer: "Starter plan: 50 videos/month. Pro plan: 500 videos/month. Agency plan: Unlimited. Most creators find the Pro plan perfect for scaling to $10K+/month income levels."
  },
  {
    question: "Will my videos look generic or robotic?",
    answer: "Absolutely not! Our AI creates unique content by analyzing millions of viral videos. Each video is customized to your brand, style, and audience. Viewers can't tell it's AI-generated - that's the magic!"
